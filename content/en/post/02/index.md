## 📝 Week 2: The Exam Session Begins

The exam session has officially started! The first exam was **Informatics**. I got a question on logic circuits and basic Python programming. It was challenging, but prior experience from practicals really helped.

I also passed the **English language credit** — thanks to prepared presentations, everything went smoothly. The teacher even praised my pronunciation and structure.

Finally, I’m starting to feel how all the learning is coming together into a cohesive whole.
