## 📐 Week 3: Math and Analysis Exams

This week was all about **differential equations**. The exam was tough — the problems weren’t easy, but good preparation paid off. I spent a lot of time reviewing past exam questions.

I also passed the **Introduction to Business Informatics** credit — we discussed the role of IT in enterprise digitalization. It was especially interesting to analyze a case on how CRM systems transform business processes.

Managed to relax a bit over the weekend — our group went to the park and played board games. A much-needed break between exams. ☀️
