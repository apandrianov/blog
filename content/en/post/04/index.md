## ðŸŽ“ Week 4: Final Credits and Project Defense

The home stretch! This week we had the **Information Theory credit** â€” the format included a mini-test and short answer questions. The professor turned it into a lively discussion, which actually made it fun.

I also presented my **course project pre-defense**. I showcased a business process model for an online store and received helpful feedback and visualization tips.

Spent the weekend relaxing a bit and organizing my notes â€” the final exam is just around the corner.
