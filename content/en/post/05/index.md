## 🏁 Week 5: End of the Exam Session and Yearly Summary

I passed the **final exam in Economics** — it was a bit nerve-wracking, but luckily the questions covered familiar topics. Result: a positive grade and a satisfying sense of closure.

Now it's time to reflect on the first year:

- Gained confidence in programming and data analysis  
- Learned to manage study time and collaborate in teams  
- Understood how business and technology intersect in the real world  

My summer plan is to find an internship and improve my English. But for now — some well-earned rest! 🎉
