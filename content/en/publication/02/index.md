## 🧾 What Are Markup Languages?

Markup languages are systems of rules and symbols used to define the structure and formatting of text. They are widely used for creating documents, websites, and technical documentation. Unlike word processors, markup languages allow a clear separation between content and presentation.

One of the most powerful and precise markup languages is **LaTeX**.
